Using sympy... 

from the js, post the typed in formula to the backend

Then:
import sympy
from sympy.parsing import sympy_parser
expression = sympy_parser.parse_expr("exp(1)")
symbols = expression.free_symbols
for each symbol...
  series = expression.series(symbol, 0, some number)
  # give the series expansion numerically
  sympy.N(series)

Return the series expansion to the client side, have it plotted via javascript
Have controls to modify variables via javascript...


Write recursive descent parser to tranform to javscript

We have to have someway of modifying the limits of the graph / do resolution
stuff on the fly, too

BIG TODO -- rename Math Query to Expression
